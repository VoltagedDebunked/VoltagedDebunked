# Welcome to Voltaged's Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm Voltaged, a 14-year-old software developer passionate about building cool stuff with code. With 2-3 years of experience under my belt, I've dabbled in various programming languages and love exploring new technologies.

## About Me

- **Age:** 14
- **Experience:** 2-3 years
- **Favorite Language:** Go (aka Golang)
- **Languages:** Rust, Go, JavaScript, C, C++, Assembly, Elixir
- **Location:** Ukraine

## My Interests

I have a keen interest in Go programming and enjoy working with its simplicity, concurrency features, and strong ecosystem. However, I also love diving into other languages like Rust for its safety guarantees, JavaScript for its versatility, and C/C++ for system-level programming. Assembly language fascinates me for its low-level control, and Elixir provides a fresh perspective on functional programming.

## Projects

Throughout my journey as a developer, I've worked on various projects ranging from web applications to system-level software. Here are a few noteworthy ones:

- **[NeuraServer](https://github.com/NeuraServer/NeuraServer):** A big pack to develop your server/service!
- **[Voltaged's Tools](https://github.com/voltageddebunked):** Open source tools to help you get started! (They are my HTML repositories on github.)
## Get in Touch
